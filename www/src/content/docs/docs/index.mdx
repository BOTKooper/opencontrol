[OpenControl](/) is a gateway that lets an LLM access any function from your codebase or any resource from your infrastructure.

- **Self-hosted**: Runs in your infrastructure with access to internal resources and functions from your codebase; deploys to AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, or containers.
- **Unified gateway**: Generates a single HTTP endpoint that you register with your LLM client and it exposes all the tools your team or project needs.
- **Universal**: Works with any LLM that supports a context protocol, like Anthropic's MCP or OpenAI's Tools.
- **Secure**: Supports authentication through any OAuth provider.
