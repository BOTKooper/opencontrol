# OpenControl

OpenControl is a context protocol gateway that can create tools any LLM can use.

- **Unified gateway**: Generates a single HTTP endpoint that you register with your LLM client and it exposes all the tools your team or project needs.
- **Self-hosted**: Runs on your infrastructure in AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, or containers; with access to internal resources and functions from your codebase.
- **Universal**: Works with any LLM that supports a context protocol, like Anthropic's MCP or OpenAI's Tools.
- **Secure**: Supports authentication through any OAuth provider.
